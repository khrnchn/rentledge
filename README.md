# Rentledge

Rentledge is a House Rental System developed using Laravel and FilamentPHP v3.

# Project Description

This project was originally intended as a collaboration with Universiti Malaysia Pahang. However, as time has passed without receiving updates from the proposing department, I've decided to take the initiative and treat this project as my personal endeavor. The primary objective is to leverage this opportunity to immerse myself in the new major update of FilamentPHP, particularly Filament v3.

By transforming this project into my personal undertaking, I aim to achieve two main goals: first, to gain hands-on experience with the latest features and improvements introduced in FilamentPHP; and second, to contribute to the continuous development of the platform. While the project's origins were collaborative, my determination to explore Filament v3 on my own terms drives the project's current direction.

# Technologies Used

- Laravel
- FilamentPHP v3
